 QUESTION: If no heading is chosen whats the default size?


 Flex moves:

justify-content
flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
center: Items align at the center of the container.
space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

align-items (align-self for individual items)
flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

direction/order: flex-direction
row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
column: Items are placed top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

order:
By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

flex-wrap:
nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

 flex-flow 
flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand property
This shorthand property accepts the value of the two properties separated by a space.

align-content
determines the spacing between lines
flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.


2/22 Notes
If you want to make two folders just use a space 
    ex: mkdir styles scripts

Shift ! = gives you a base HTML layout

How to link to CSS 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href ="styles/style.css">

Classes are shared
Ids are unique

Lists
if your ranking use ol 
if its a random list use ul
li is only used for lists

Dev Tools
right click inspect or f12

Padding is inside the box
margins is space around the box

if you put flexbox on big container the contents will go side by side
